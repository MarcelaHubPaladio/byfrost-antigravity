# Supabase local/dev config

# IMPORTANT:
# - public-proposal is a PUBLIC endpoint (no login); it must NOT require JWT verification.
# - party-upload-logo performs manual auth (Authorization Bearer access_token + membership check);
#   keeping verify_jwt=false avoids the gateway rejecting tokens before our checks.
#
# If you deploy via Supabase Dashboard, ensure "Verify JWT" is turned OFF for these functions.
